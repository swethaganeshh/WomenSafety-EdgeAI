# 🛡️ Women Safety App – AI-Powered Scream Detection  
### Edge Impulse Integrated · Real-Time Distress Monitoring · Automatic SOS

Hey there! This project is an impactful blend of **AI**, **mobile development**, and **safety innovation** — built to protect women in real-world emergency situations. With **Edge Impulse’s on-device ML**, the app listens for distress cues like *screams*, *“help”*, and sudden loud noises, and triggers **automatic SOS actions** — even when the user cannot tap a button.

---

## 🌟 What This Project Solves

Women often face unsafe situations where they:

❌ Cannot press an SOS button  
❌ Cannot unlock their phone  
❌ Cannot call for help  
❌ Panic or freeze  
❌ Are physically restricted  

Traditional safety apps depend on manual triggers — which fail when they matter most.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

There is a need for a safety system that:

- ⚡ Works automatically  
- 🎧 Detects danger in real time  
- 🆘 Sends alerts without user input  
- 📡 Works even offline  
- 🛟 Helps women get immediate support  

This project solves that using **AI-based scream detection**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A mobile app powered by **Edge Impulse’s audio classification model** that detects:

- 🔊 Scream-like audio  
- 🗣️ Distress keywords (“Help”, “Stop”)  
- 🔉 Sudden loud noises  
- 🎙️ Unusual audio patterns  

When danger is detected → **Automatic SOS**, **GPS sharing**, **audio recording**, and **contact alerts**.
